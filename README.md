As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike, my new responsibilities are to oversee the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In new role, main task is to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

In this latest project my task is to analyse latest data for June 2024 by looking into following:

1.How many trips have been recorded in total during June 2024?

2. What procentage in total trips are taken by members and what by casual users?

3. What are peak hours that the bikes are used during this period for both groups?

4. What is the average time the bikes are used by members and casual users and what type of bikes they prefer renting?

5. What are most popular starting and ending stations for members as well as for casual users?

The different visualizations(including Maps) are created and used to design a two different dashboards (members dashboard and casual users dashboard). Detailed analysis of my interesting findings is done in Tableau story.
